# Personal-Projects
A repository where I'll post all of my random, personal projects

### MusicCleaner  
  * Really simple program to clean up a Mac's iTunes music directory of unnecessary pictures and `.DS_Store` files
  * Physically deletes files in the provided directory, so run at one's own risk. Although it __shouldn't__ delete anything but a `.DS_Store`, `.png`, or `.jpg` files which it does automatically (also deletes duplicate songs but that's the point..)
### MediaAnalysis
  * A Processing-based visualization program that displays `.csv` formatted duration data as one continuous day.
  * Personally used for showing when, throughout the day, I watch TV. Can also be used for other kinds of duration data, but it needs to be equivalently formatted.
  * Written in Java, but utilizes some of Processing's drawing functionality. The output visualization is to be read bottom -> top, left -> right.
