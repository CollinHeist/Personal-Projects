\section{Findings}
According to the Tracealyzer program, the Idle task takes up about 0.843\% of the CPU. This is about what I expected, especially for a program that switches to the idle task so frequently; although in a larger program I suspect this should be much smaller.

I suspect that the reason Task 2 takes up slightly (0.5\%) more CPU usage is entirely related to where I stopped the program. However, I am not sure about this.

\section{Results}
Below is a screen capture of the Actor Statistics Report. As expected, the percent of the time that the CPU spends on the non-idle tasks is significantly higher than that of the idle task.
