% Beginning of Report
My suggestion for the final project is to design a program, broken up into FreeRTOS tasks, that uses DMA to transfer ADC readings to a user-defined space in memory. There would then be a task that, when the ADC has taken a specific number of readings, would transfer that information to the EEPROM. The user could then request a page of data from a specific location in memory via a webserver over TCP. The program would respond with that data, and it would be displayed on the webpage in a convenient page-by-page program.
