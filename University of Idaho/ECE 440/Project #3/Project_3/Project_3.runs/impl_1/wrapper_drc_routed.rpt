2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
IOSR-1#1 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO switches[0] connects to flops which have these debounce_inst/x_reg[3], debounce_inst/y_reg[3] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#2 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO switches[1] connects to flops which have these debounce_inst/x_reg[3], debounce_inst/y_reg[3] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#3 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO switches[2] connects to flops which have these debounce_inst/x_reg[3], debounce_inst/y_reg[3] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#4 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO switches[3] connects to flops which have these debounce_inst/x_reg[3], debounce_inst/y_reg[3] set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
